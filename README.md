# Bluetooth and Wifi Setup
This repository is responsible for the Syne NP-19's internet connection and credential transfer. This repo's responsibilities are:
1. Request, accept, and maintain a bluetooth connection to a device in setup mode
2. Transfer wifi credentials to the device from a connected (phone running flutter app) device
3. Accept DSP credentials from the connected (phone) device
